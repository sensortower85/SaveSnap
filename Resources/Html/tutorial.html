        When you receive a snap from the <span class="snapchat">Snapchat</span>, Launch <span class="savesnap">SaveSnap</span> for <span class="snapchat">Snapchat</span>. <br/>
            </LI>
            <LI>
        After successful login you can see the list of the snaps you have received. <br/>
            </LI>
            <LI>
        Tap the one (which has available to download status) you wish to view and wait until fetch is finished.<br/>
            </LI>
